  # NOTE: The ref for pull request triggered events defaults to
  # `refs/pull/<pr-number>/merge`, this is essentially the virtual merge ref
  # that would be created if the pr was merged. This means your linting checks
  # actually gives you a much better idea of whether the linting will pass once
  # merged.
